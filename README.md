# Attendance Check

AngularJS project created in Visual Studio 2013 that shows three ways of displaying individual attendance (can be used for tracking 
vacation days, sick days, etc.).  This project is currenlty setup to show a calendar view, an individual attendance sheet view, and an
overview that displays overall taken/scheduled vacation or sick days.  

This project is read-only, nothing setup for adding/editing data.  No backend has been setup, data is stored in objects.

Libraries/Frameworks Used:
AngularJS
Bootstrap
Lodash (very little)
FullCalendar


TODO:

Objects for storing the data are setup in separate JS files, need to consolidate and improve the data design of the objects, 
possibly set something up in JSON instead.

Setup a data entry/modification screen.
